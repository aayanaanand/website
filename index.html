                    <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
                    <p>My name is Aayana Anand (she/her), and I'm a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, having obtained my Bachelors of Science in Information Analysis from the School of Information (UMSI) and a Certificate of Leadership from the Barger Leadership Institute/MLead. I’m now working full-time as a Data Analyst at Stryker, focusing on Customer and Market Analytics for Customer Solutions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've spent most of my life in Michigan. I’m also a first generation American and daughter of immigrants. I place an especially high value on diversity, equity, and inclusion in social spaces and workplaces.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My passion is leveraging data/technology/information for social good – using technical skills to gain insights about the world and subsequently use those insights to find solutions to problems. In the process, I aim to approach my work collaboratively, ethically, and with an agile mindset.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Outside of my work, I love trying out coffee/boba shops, listening to music, watching rom-coms, and hanging out with my friends! 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Feel free to shoot me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn if you're interested in seeing my resume, discussing potential opportunities, or just chatting! I’m always open to meeting new people and learning about their experiences.
                    </p>
