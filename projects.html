                <h2>Greenfoot Fun Run</h2>
                <p>This project was completed by my friend and I in high school for AP Computer Science A using Java. Inspired by scenes from Season 5 and Season 7 of The Office, Fun Run is an obstacle game where the player dodges show-relevant obstacles (squirrels, alfredo, etc.). The project is coded using the Java language but is delivered using Greenfoot.</p>

                <h2>Spotify Data Capstone Project</h2>
                <p>I find Spotify data to be one of the most interesting things to analyze, and it seems like many users agree (Spotify Wrapped is highly anticipated for a reason)! For my capstone project in the Python for Everybody specialization, I decided to use Python and SQL to make a simple program relating to my personal Spotify data as of April 2022. The program allows for the user to input an artist’s name and outputs information from my data pertaining to that artist. It also stores my data into SQL databases.

                <h2>Never Lose a Footrest Again</h2>
                <p>From volunteering at a group home in high school, I noticed an issue with wheelchairs being used in common areas. Oftentimes, wheelchairs don’t fit well through entries and doorways. I decided to do something about this by modifying the footrest design of wheelchairs. Normally, the footrests are stowed outward, but stowing them inward would allow for the width of the wheelchair to be reduced. I proposed this as a design patent to the USPTO.

                <h2>How Starbucks uses Technology to Trick us All</h2>
                <p>This is a longform blog post I wrote and published on Medium as a project for SI 110 in spring 2022, which earned a grade of 238/250. I wrote about the ways that Starbucks uses Information Science principles to “trick” customers and continue a positive feedback loop of customer interaction, which ultimately drives a significant portion of their success today.

                <h2>UM Wayfinding App</h2>
                <p>This is a UX Research project I completed as a part of my Winter 2023 coursework in class SI 422, "Needs and Usability Evalutions." This project was conducted over the span of 9 weeks by myself and 2 other students. The goal of our research was to understand what students on our campus like and dislike about current navigational tools/experiences and use that information to design a new wayfinding app. Our project followed field-style UX research methods and components, such as interviewing, affinity diagramming, surveying, survey analysis, and qualitative data coding. Our final deliverables consisted of 2 personas, 1 storyboard, and 1 experience map. Independently, I developed a portfolio piece containing the details of the project.</p>
